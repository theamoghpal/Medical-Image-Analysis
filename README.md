# Malaria-Detection


Malaria Detection using Image Processing
This project utilizes image processing techniques to automatically detect the presence of malaria parasites in thin blood smear images.

Project Goals:

Develop an image processing pipeline for malaria detection.
Train a machine learning model to accurately classify infected and uninfected red blood cells.
Evaluate the performance of the model on real-world data.
